Two years ago, I start playing Blue Archive. 

I was a FGO player before, but I deleted my Bilibili account out of dislike for the platform, and since it was the only way to access my FGO China server account, I lost access to the game completely. Starting fresh on the Japanese server would be too difficult to catch up. Besides, since FGO's main value lies in its story, which I can read in either Japanese or English from YouTube, I don't feel the need to continue playing.

After playing Blue Archive for 2 years, I'm confident that I surpass most players in strategy, which stems from from my FGO experience.

## Typical Tactic of FGO Players

All skilled FGO plays must have done these 4 things: RNG hunting, min-maxing the sequence, do math before challenging, optimize the buffs. Who hasn't done these things must be a beginner.

RNG hunting doesn't need much explanation, as it's very common. It's seeking perfect card draws or critical hits in FGO, or in similar situation in Blue Archive.

Whether it's daily quests, speed-running challenges, maintaining continuous buffs, or solo boss fights - all of these strategies require careful sequencing. In my opinion, the most impressive examples are the [Mash solo run against Arash in Nero celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBZjzCCJ248) and the [13 Command Spells clear vs Kirschtaria]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIHW-iOGbQ0)) - with the latter being **designed to be impossible** by the developer, yet players found a way.

Though most FGO players don't memorize the complete damage formula, they understand the basics of the four buff types and their stacking mechanics.

> There are four main buff categories in FGO's damage calculation. Buffs of the same type (like ATK up and DEF down) add together linearly - for example, +10% ATK and -10% enemy DEF equals +20% ATK. Different types of buffs multiply with each other, leading to diminishing returns when stacking same-type buffs, as 
> 
> $$(1+a)(1+b)=1+a+b+ab>1+a+b$$ 
> 
> This is why combining buffs from different categories is generally more effective than stacking buffs of the same type.

Since FGO lacks an auto-clear system, players must complete daily quests manually, turning these routine tasks into mini speed-running challenges. To achieve efficient farming, players need 10 specific servants, with 6 of them being limited (Koyanskaya of Light, Altria Caster, Oberon, Merlin, Scáthach-Skadi Ruler, Scáthach-Skadi Caster). For new players, the only way to obtain this optimal farming setup is to purchase an account from other players, as collecting all these limited servants would be practically impossible.
